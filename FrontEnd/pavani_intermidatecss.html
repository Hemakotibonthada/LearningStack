    <div>Best group for a tank is of course a mix of buffers, 
        a large number of damage dealers and nukers, and maybe a healer. 
        Best buffer for the tank himself is a Prophet who avoids buffing 
        'Berserker Spirit' to the tank, plus an Elven Elder - because of their Agility buff,
         but they can also give mana and healing and</div>

            Of course the other party members will prefer other buffer classes
             which optimize offense instead of defense. Most annoying for the 
              tank is probably an Overlord because they buff Berzerker Spirit - 
            on everyone of the alliance, so you don't even have to be in party with 
            the Overlord to receive this buff.
